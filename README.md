# ASDC

For now, ASDC stands for "A Simple Dungeon Crawler", but it will likely change.
It is a project where to goal is to teach myself modern C++ by building a roguelike / dungeon crawler game.

The game uses an Entity-Component-System architecture, and the code for that has been almost 100% taken from [RLTK](https://github.com/thebracket/rltk).

Instead of just copy-pasting the code, or including it as a library, I typed out all the code I needed and adapted it slightly to fit in with my project.
I find that this helps me understand the code much better than if I'm just reading the code.
I also made an effort to really understand the code and how everything fit together. It took me some hours, but doing it this way has really helped me understand a lot more about how the RLTK ECS works, and also more generally about templates and specialized classes and various other parts of modern C++.
I might add that I think the RLTK ECS is a really well-written, elegant and flexible system! I've been struggling to figure out how to program something like this, and now I think I finally understand it!

I might livestream further development sessions.
